-All swaps are executed on Uniswap  
-Supported uniswap pairs are limited initially, but additional pair oracles will be continuously deployed overtime  
-User sets the swap price limit(s) of the asset pair, and also swap slippage %  
-User deposits assets to deposit pool contract and receives an ERC721 in return  
-User is rewarded ERC20 NOCT tokens after swap limit order is executed and swapped asset is claimed   
-User can withdraw the asset in full from the contract at anytime, but will not receive NOCT rewards if the deposited assets are withdrawn early  
-User's NOCT rewards are a function of the platform deposit rate and average gas price (gwei) at time of deposit  
-User also earns NOCT when executing swap limit orders (settlement like BIOP) and when updating uniswap pair oracles (if updates are necessary)   
-Earned NOCT is a function of gas paid when executing swap limit orders (incentivize fast swapping) and oracle updates  
-When executing swap limit orders, a min gas price requirement is set and will equal the current Chainlink gas price feed (average-fast)  
-Contracts are written so that events are emitted on-chain whenever an active swap limit order is ready for execution (for bot deployment)  
-Fees are collected from users upon each asset deposit and each early asset deposit withdrawal  
-Fees are distributed to NOCT burners  
-When a NOCT holder burns NOCT, they forever earn a percentage of the accumulated platform fees (similar to whiteheart staking)  
-The earned fees are equal to the % of their burned NOCT with respect to the total burned NOCT    
-Fees are distributed to the NOCT burner addresses on every fee collecting event (real-time like whiteheart)  
-The ERC721 received after deposit records all user swap limit order information  
-The information recorded by the ERC721 is the swap pair address, pair token amount, and pair token swap price target(s)  
-After the user's swap limit order is executed, the ERC721 can be exchanged for the traded assets and the associated NOCT rewards  
-The user's ERC721 can also be exchanged for the deposited assets prior to the swap limit order execution (without NOCT rewards)    
-The swap deposit ERC721 is burned after it has been exchanged for the traded or deposited asset
