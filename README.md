# nocturnal.finance - a simple UI for incentivized publically executed Uniswap limit orders

-Swaps are executed on the Uniswap dex  
-User specifies asset trading pair by contract addresses  
-User sets the swap limit(s) of the asset pair (Uniswap Router -> amountoutmin)  
-User deposits asset and receives an ERC721 in return  
-User is rewarded ERC20 NOCT tokens after swap limit order is executed  
-User can monitor accumulated NOCT rewards while the assets are deposited on nocturnal.finance UI (calculated per block)  
-User can withdraw the asset in full from the contract at anytime, but will not receive NOCT rewards if the deposited assets are withdrawn early   
-User's NOCT rewards are a function of the value of total deposited assets, total time deposited, and other yet TBD variables  
-User can also earn NOCT by executing any active swap limit orders (paying for Ethereum transaction gas cost)  
-The amount of NOCT rewarded to a user for executing a swap limit order is a function of the gas paid for the transaction  
-When a user executes an active swap limit order, they must use a "high" gas limit ("high" definition is TBD)  
-Contracts are written so that events are emitted on-chain whenever an active swap limit order is ready for execution (for bot deployment)  
-Fees are collected from users upon each asset deposit, each active swap limit order execution, and each early asset deposit withdrawal  
-A portion of the fees is collected for Chainlink price feed data costs  
-A portion of the fees is collected for Ethereum transaction gas costs (for sending ERC721 to user)  
-Users can earn rewards by staking NOCT  
-The remainder of all collected fees goes to NOCT stakers (in the form of USDC)  
-Users can stake their NOCT through nocturnal.finance UI, and receive ERC20 sNOCT tokens in return  
-An ERC721 is created and issued to a user after a swap limit order is created and the swap asset is deposited  
-The ERC721 records all user swap limit order information  
-After the user's swap limit order is executed, the ERC721 can be exchanged for the traded asset and any accumulated NOCT  
-The user's ERC721 can also be exchanged for the deposited assets prior to the swap limit order execution  
-If the ERC721 is exchanged for the deposited assets prior to the swap limit order execution, no accumulated NOCT is rewarded    
-The ERC721 is burned after it has been exchanged for the traded or deposited asset  
-UI will share similar styles and elements as whiteheart.finance, biopset.com, and uniswap.org UIs  
-UI will include a realtime chart of selected assets, and user will be able to select limits with cursor on chart
