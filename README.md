# nocturnal.finance - a simple UI for incentivized publically executed Uniswap limit orders

-Swaps are executed on Uniswap  
-Supported uniswap pairs are limited, but additional pair oracles will be continuously deployed overtime  
-User sets the swap price limit(s) of the asset pair, and also swap slippage %  
-User deposits assets to deposit pool contract and receives an ERC721 in return  
-User is rewarded ERC20 NOCT tokens after swap limit order is executed and swapped asset is claimed   
-User can withdraw the asset in full from the contract at anytime, but will not receive NOCT rewards if the deposited assets are withdrawn early   
-User's NOCT rewards are a function of the platform deposit rate and average gas price (gwei) at time of deposit  
-User also earn NOCT when executing swap limit orders and when updating uniswap pair oracles  
-Earned NOCT is a function of gas paid when earned for executing swap limit orders (incentivize fast swapping)  
-When executing swap limit orders, a min gas price requirement is set and will equal the current Chainlink gas price feed (average-fast)  
-Contracts are written so that events are emitted on-chain whenever an active swap limit order is ready for execution (for bot deployment)  
-Fees are collected from users upon each asset deposit and each early asset deposit withdrawal  
-Fees are distributed to NOCT burners  
-When a NOCT holder burns NOCT, they earn a permanent stake in platform fees  
-The earned fees are distributed at every deposit/early withdrawal, and are equal to the % of total burned NOCT at the time  
-Another ERC721 is created and issued to a user after their swap limit order is created and their swap assets are deposited  
-The ERC721 records all user swap limit order information (swap pair address, pair token amount, pair token swap price target)  
-After the user's swap limit order is executed, the ERC721 can be exchanged for the traded assets and the associated NOCT rewards  
-The user's ERC721 can also be exchanged for the deposited assets prior to the swap limit order execution  
-If the ERC721 is exchanged for the deposited assets prior to the swap limit order execution, no NOCT is rewarded  
-The swap deposit ERC721 is burned after it has been exchanged for the traded or deposited asset  
-UI will share similar styles and elements as whiteheart.finance, biopset.com, dextools.io, and uniswap.org UIs
